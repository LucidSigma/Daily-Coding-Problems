An external merge sort is a viable option.

- Divide the data into smaller heaps that fit on memory
- Read a single heap into memory and sort it using an efficient algorithm (quicksort, mergesort, et cetera)
- Write the sorted heap to a file
- Repeat the previous two steps for each heap
- Read the first few (about several thousand) numbers from each file into memory
- Merge each of these mini-heaps in memory into a single sorted heap and write it to file
- Repeat the previous two steps until all numbers have been sorted and appended to the file
