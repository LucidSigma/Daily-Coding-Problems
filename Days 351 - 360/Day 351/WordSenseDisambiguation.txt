Compare the current word to other words in the sentences to gain a context.
A machine learning algorithm can be used to create a neural network of linked words - and can be trained by analysis many different sentences containing the same context of the word.
This neural network can be compared to the list of definitions to find the most likely meaning.
Some fuzzy logic will still need to be used, since some definitions might be too similar to distinguish and it will have to be guessed.
