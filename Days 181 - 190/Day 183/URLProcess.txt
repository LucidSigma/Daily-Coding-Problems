The URL is parsed and determined if it is a link or search term.
The non-ASCII Unicode charaters are converted in the hostname.
The HSTS list is checked to see if the contact protocol is HTTP or HTTPS.
The browser does a DNS lookup to get the IP address.
The ARP process occurs where it finds the MAC address.
A socket is opened and the client and server complete a TLS handshake.
The HTTP operations send a GET request to the host, which usually responds with the website information (such as HTML).
The browser then parses the HTML, CSS and JavaScript and creates the DOM tree.
The page is structued from the HTML and interpreted from the CSS; then the page is rendered.
